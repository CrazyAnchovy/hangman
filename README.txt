Thank you for downloading HangMan 1.0!

acknowledgments of areas of improvement:

line 79, correctGuesses[] - currently, if you choose the correct letter over and over again, you will win the game.
	i started to impliment the list of correctGuesses[] to deny the incrementation of correctLetters, but I
	didn't have enough time. 8(

lines 84-92 i feel that there could be a better way to do it instead of opening the file 3 times.

lines 125-137 incorrectGuessAttempts - this really needs to be a list or dictionary of functions. the repetition needs to be coded out

line 143 do i need to pop the blank out and add the letter? can this be one step?

lines 160-164 i found that i needed to reset everything for a fresh game, but it feels dumb to redeclare my variables again.
	don't know what to do here.

************************************************************************************

In this exciting word game of life or death, you will be prompted to 
choose letters to solve a word. Sounds easy enough, but in this
edition, you have over EIGHT HUNDRED words! And if that's not enough, 
your goal is to save an innocent man from being hanged until
dead from the gallows.

Future additions to hangman1.0 to include

* difficulty levels: choose a difficulty level, and the secret word will be chosen
	from a list corresponding to that difficulty level.

* after you've made a mistake or two, i don't feel like the same
	message at the bottom needs to display i.e. sufferin sucatash etc.
	i feel i could get more creative with that.
