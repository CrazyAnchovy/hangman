In this exciting word game of life or death, you will be prompted to 
choose letters to solve a word. Sounds easy enough, but in this
edition, you have over EIGHT HUNDRED words! And if that's not enough, 
your goal is to save an innocent man from being hanged until
dead from the gallows.

Future additions to hangman1.0 to include

* difficulty levels: choose a difficulty level, and the secret word will be chosen
	from a list corresponding to that difficulty level.

* after you've made a mistake or two, i don't feel like the same
	message at the bottom needs to display i.e. sufferin sucatash etc.
	i feel i could get more creative with that.
